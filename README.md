# Warframe: Turn Based Edition
A reimagining of warframe as a turn based text game, created using Visual Studio in C++

This is not yet playable.

This is going to include the original 8 warframes and a handful of enemies from the 3 main factions to start with

Eventually, I would like to add loot, warframe modding, more frame, and more enemies, amongst other things

The user is going to be able to select any 4 of the 8 frames avalible, with duplicates, and will have to face a small group of enemies. Then on each turn, the user can select what ability each frame gets to use, and what to target it on if applicable. The frames initially will not have access to weapons.

I hope to have something playable by the end of the year. This is a project that I only get to work on every once in a while due to having to deal with a full course load at uni + a part time job.

# Warframe-Turn-Based-Edition
A reimagining of warframe as a turn based text game

This is going to include the original 8 warframes and a handful of enemies from the 3 main factions to start with

Eventually, I would like to add loot, warframe modding, more frame, and more enemies, amongst other things

The user is going to be able to select any 4 of the 8 frames avalible, with duplicates, and will have to face a small group of enemies. Then on each turn, the user can select what ability each frame gets to use, and what to target it on if applicable.

There currently isn't much to this project, as it is mostly an idea at the moment, but I hope to flesh it out over my free time this semester
